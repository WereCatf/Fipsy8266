# Fipsy8266
This is hastily thrown-together frontend for the libFipsy8266, intended to make it reasonably easy and simple to manage the Fipsy FPGA-board via a web-browser. For now, it's still a WIP and probably very buggy. Actually programming of the FPGA isn't implemented just yet, either.

# Requirements
* [The great WiFiManager by tzapu](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager)
